# Bus-Routes_Graph-Theory

A problem is the inefficiencies in shuttle routes around the campus of Syracuse University. A solutuion is to use graph theory to model routes, identify bottlenecks, and optimize paths using Python and NetworkX. NetworkX is a Python library for creating, visualizing, and analyzing graphs. NetworkX makes it easy to create and manipulate graphs with built-in algorithims for the shortest path and connectivity. 

Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search was implemeted, as well as Dihkstra's Algoritihm.

Some challenges I faced:
Scalability: Large graphs can be computationally expensive.
Data Accuracy: Graphs depend on accurate data inputs.
Dynamic Networks: Real-world networks often change over time.
